# gui.py
• My first attempt at a GUI! This program allows NWI To track inventory and calculate transactions with applicable welfare programs.

• This is also the first project I compiled to .app and .exe!

• Produce grown in Michigan are able to be bought with [Market Fresh coupons](https://www.michigan.gov/documents/osa/2018_Market_Masters_presentation_624735_7.pdf), so three seperate calculations are made for total price, non MI grown produce, and Micigan grown produce.
